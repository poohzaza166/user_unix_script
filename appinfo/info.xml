    <summary>User management and authentication through arbitrary shell scripts</summary>
    <description>
        <![CDATA[
			This app allows you to do user management against arbitrary UNIX shell commands. You can authenticate, create, delete users, as well as change their
			password. The list of users is fetched from /etc/password file and the description of the user is fetched by reading the 'gecos' property of the
			user. The application also includes pre and post executions if you need to trigger a shell script before or after an action. For instance, after a password
			change you might need to execute a synchronization.

			The scripts executed can be variables defined as :
		 	* %u -> The username on which we make an action
		 	* %p -> The password if provided with the action

			By default, only users with UID >= 1000 are allowed to authenticate. If a command has no shell script defined, it will be automatically deactivated.
			The configuration and details of the app are available in README.md.
